# Jeff Rowell

Principal Security Engineer with 9+ years experience focused on:
- learning
- collaboration
- automation

While my work from my job can't be shared, I am constantly trying to learn and some of my open source contributions can be seen below:
- **Trufflehog:** added detectors for two new secret types, wrote unit and integration tests, merge pending based on project maintenance.
  * https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/pull/4347
- **Embedded Firmware Analyzer (EMBA):** added a feature that improved firmware rescanning time from an avg of two hours to 15 minutes for detecting new CVEs.
  * https://github.com/e-m-b-a/emba/pull/1615
- **YASH:** while working through Stanford's compiler course, I found and fixed a [bug](https://github.com/babyraging/yash/issues/38) for a VS Code syntax highlighter for Bison/Yacc. The bug didn't allow preceding whitespaces on lines and thus broke the syntax highlighting.
  * https://github.com/babyraging/yash/pull/39

Currently working on secrets management for NHI at scale, integrating AppSec tools into CI/CD, and internal tooling written in Go and Python to normalize asset findings for ASPM.
