# Jeff Rowell

Principal Security Engineer with 9+ years experience focused on:
- learning
- collaboration
- automation

While the work from my job can't be publicly shared, I am constantly trying to learn and some of my open source contributions can be seen below:
* https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/pull/4347 - added detectors for two new secret types, wrote unit and integration tests, merge pending based on project maintenance discussions.
* https://github.com/e-m-b-a/emba/pull/1615 - added a feature that improved firmware rescanning time from an avg of two hours to 15 minutes for detecting new CVEs.
* https://github.com/babyraging/yash/pull/39 - while working through Stanford's compiler course, I found and fixed a [bug](https://github.com/babyraging/yash/issues/38) for a VS Code syntax highlighter for Bison/Yacc (now I use neovim btw).

At my job I'm currently working on secrets management for NHI at scale, integrating AppSec tools into CI/CD, and internal tooling written in Go to normalize asset findings for ASPM.
